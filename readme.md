# SIM Static Site

ðŸ”¥ Static Site for SIM conference

## Architecture


* Static files are manually uploaded to the Wordpress file system
* HTML is included in the Wordpress page using [CSI.js](https://github.com/LexmarkWeb/csi.js)
* When the page is loaded, JS in the static page executes, parsing the injected JSON and rendering the schedule.


## Development

Custom build script powered by Gulp.

```bash
npm i
gulp # Watches source directory and autorebuilds on changes. 
# you'll need to manually reload the browder (Cmd + R in Chrome)
```

> Slow build systems should not exist. This build script is optimized to run everything blazing fast. In live rebuild mode the site rebuilds in less than 16ms. Production builds take less than 4 seconds (most of which is Tailwind stripping away all unused CSS styles)

## Customization

See the `config` directory.

## Deployment

There are two deployment modes:
1. Static page to S3
2. Static assets to upload to Wordpress

`gulp build` creates three files in `dist`:

* `index.html`
* `styles.css`
* `scripts.js`


```bash
gulp build # Builds dist directory
deploy.sh # Builds and uploads to S3
```
